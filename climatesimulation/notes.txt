1 finish the first chart
   (save current example
  a add green and blue balls
  b emissions are red
  c for each y coordinate show the average temperature over 100 seconds for each second
    (ie 1 number for average temp, x axis is y coordinates or something like that)
  d add a "reduce emissions over time" variable to simulate climate change  



1 make the light rotate around the x and z axis to simulate spinning (probably easier than making the whole thing spin)
  a do a tiny little sun on a rotational vector (or it can be completely black or even not having a mesh
  b compute a random point near it and aim like the gravity thing (only one push instead of acceleration)
  
  
1 heat distribution map

1 slow collisions down maybe (possibly reduce solver to 1)
2 change heat given off to green



4 represent escaping heat (have some random particles bouncing off of the outside that start out black
  collide, and then turn red, and then dissapear



1 figure out collision detection
2 each atmosphere should transfer heat on collision
3 they should change color based on that




1 create a sphere
2 create a really small sphere
