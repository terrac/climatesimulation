1 emissions are a never ending 


2 allow a box that lets you alter emission levels 
  a a simple text box that says current emission levels
  b emissions are like before, things that get created, fly towards earth and then fly away taking some heat
  c add back in atmosphere
  d convert to realistic units (make emissions more complicated, change indivual things)
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
3 show overall temperature increase based on emission levels
4 write out an object that could be used to 3d print a spherical earth




1 click on an individual spot to see average temperature increase based on emissions
  a clicking + box that shows cli (look for an example)
  b more later
  
  

1 add counters to test and display statistics

1 add reddish hue based on heat 
  a save initial color
  b add x amount of red based on heat
  c collisions transfer heat
2 show reports  


#1 make sun pass through atmosphere
#2 shrink atmosphere dramatically (due to other stuff being static)
#3 for a given range of blue reset the mass



1 take simulation logic
2 add in the heat distribution
3 add in the sun
4 add in emissions
5 build the graph, compare to http://www.earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/2620

6 put on website                             


1 function to create the equivalent of more suns but smaller and asteroid colored
2 add a semi random force
3 do the same with rockets (more brightly colored)
4 on click do the draw bounding box logic and save
5 on click again draw another bounding box and if one is a rocket and the the other is an asteroid
  then apply a force from the rocket to the asteroid.  if the rocket hits earth it explodes



1 create an astroid away from the radius 
2 spin it in a random direction
3 do the same for a few rockets
4 clicking on a rocket highlights it
5 clicking on an asteroid calculates an intercept course
6 the rocket intercepts and applies a force towards

1 redirection mining
  a the story is that there is a corporation that successfully has built rockets based on goverment funding
  b and they have some extra room and you want to use that to mine different rocks.  So what you have done is 
  c built a redirector.  A machine that is nuclear powered and your goal is to knock asteroids into the ocean
    preferably nearer to a certain point.  The idea is that because you have planned this you can get there
    first and reap the rewards.


Surface mining[edit]
On some types of asteroids, material may be scraped off the surface using a scoop or auger, or for larger pieces, an "active grab."[17] There is strong evidence that many asteroids consist of rubble piles,[29] making this approach possible.

Shaft mining[edit]
A mine can be dug into the asteroid, and the material extracted through the shaft. This requires precise knowledge to engineer accuracy of astro-location under the surface regolith and a transportation system to carry the desired ore to the processing facility.

Magnetic rakes[edit]
Asteroids with a high metal content may be covered in loose grains that can be gathered by means of a magnet.[17][30]

Heating[edit]
For volatile materials in extinct comets, heat can be used to melt and vaporize the matrix.[17][31]

1 story
the goal is to build robots that colonize the solar system and make livable places
It is like the kerbal space program where you have component parts and you put them together


you start off with a simple robotic design and a budget.  You have practical research,
making, goals, and exploration

1 first robot is a simple near earth miner designed to bring back raw materials
2 you first start with a government budget and a mandate
3 as you succeed various CEOs complain about losing their companies and you lose your budget unexpectedly
4 you then have to actually compete and bring in more raw materials
5 over time you get more options like builder robots and more automated robots (ie they start out human controlled)
6 lots of little blurbs about the future 
7 you design the miners, the asteroids are simple physics based items and you combine physics and various rules 

























1 no gravity, no physics (still use physics engine)


1 new javascript file put gravity in center
2 simulate unrealistic population growth

1st starting in africa, spreading out across the world
  a create a new test
  b pull code out to create earth
  c for loop every turn that increases the population
  d every so often the population increment changes
  e climate changes affect human spread
  
2 congregating in the right climate ( and having the right climate for 200,000 years ago
                                             (basically sahara/middle east = tropical, dont worry about the rest)
3 drop people in start, let them spread out, color code them maybe

1 a civilization game
  a a space civ game based on the solar system
  b different nations 
  c the goal is nothing 
  d topical events (like climate change, ferguson, etc)
  e stat based (lots and lots of stats)
  f first goal good internet searching
  g second goal electric cars
  h third goal renewable energy (choices to make)
  i fourth helping people meet each other
  j blacklivesmatter (choices)
  k russia invading crimea (choices)
  l invading iraq (choices)
2 you get binary choices that are somewhat randomized and affect stats.  Stats affect which events occur somewhat randomized
3 choices should be non obvious  (ie you choose to focus on issue X and that improves, but other things happen later)  
  
  
1 create an intermediate step that takes in all of the maps and combines them into one data set
2 temperature map
  population map
  countries map?
3 something that switches colors in between  
4 formula that runs through all and does xxx
5 physical demonstration (emissions, heat in the middle)
6 comparison
7 video (and website)  


1 take code and put into previous framework as a layer (import the image, but hide after importing)
2 more maps
  a heat map
  //2 sea level map
  //3 elevation map
  4 population map
  combine them all through making them roughly the same size, picking the same points on each one
  and adding that data onto each sphere


1 take all bodies
2 sort by y axis (then x axis)
3 loop through positions an additional time and assign color
4 the eendd




1 more spheres towards the center
  a divide by half and then subtract current number
  b mulitply the absolute value times a constant
  c the hi



1 take testPicturePosition.html 
2 map it to small colored balls with no gravity (ie add demo, add visual, then nothing)
if it is the right sphere then continue



















1 pull from laptop and sync with desktop

#1 a large atmosphere type / large atmosphere layer
#2 no "on collision" detection, 
run on things that aren't asleep using lists 
#3 increase steps slowly to 600 (too slow)
4 make like earth (whether with a designer or the other thing)
5 cook the earth (slider for co2, water vapor, natural disasters)





1 finish up mapping to 

1 i am dropdown (god,g-d,allah,nothing, the vegan omnipresence,
2 i want to destroy the disbelievers/believers (based on previous choice)
3 but first I have to create the earth

1 co2 level
2 atmospheric moisture
  (both reduce emissions, one by more)
3 relate heat to real temperatures (but internally just use "heat")
4 specific disasters (like yellowstone)
  

 


1 17 fps is fine when you aren't going for speed (ie slow down steps essentially to deal with slowness)
2


1 %visibility (basically to test speed issues)
2












1 test sap broadphase



1 save example
2 object oriented framework for climate change simulation
  a conductivity
  b visibility (on/off)
  c filter group (view-source:http://schteppe.github.io/cannon.js/demos/collisionFilter.html)
  d density (ie mass) probably wont be that useful
  e layer (create equally all around in different layers)
  f light (chance of changing to heat)
  g colors
  h reflectivity  
  i change in color based on heat
  j axial tilt
  k sleepiness
  l size
reduce emissions
  save example
2 add in spheres that are invisible (ie air)
3 land/water has higher mass
4 light passes through invisible, but heat can get trapped
5 give different light to heat values for land/air/poles
6 poles are just land values with a low enough score to turn white
  they then have a lower light to heat value





1 finish the first chart
   (save current example
  #a add green and blue balls
  #b emissions are red
  c for each y coordinate show the average temperature over 100 seconds for each second
    (ie 1 number for average temp, x axis is y coordinates or something like that)
  d add a "reduce emissions over time" variable to simulate climate change  



1 make the light rotate around the x and z axis to simulate spinning (probably easier than making the whole thing spin)
  a do a tiny little sun on a rotational vector (or it can be completely black or even not having a mesh
  b compute a random point near it and aim like the gravity thing (only one push instead of acceleration)
  
  
1 heat distribution map

1 slow collisions down maybe (possibly reduce solver to 1)
2 change heat given off to green



4 represent escaping heat (have some random particles bouncing off of the outside that start out black
  collide, and then turn red, and then dissapear



1 figure out collision detection
2 each atmosphere should transfer heat on collision
3 they should change color based on that




1 create a sphere
2 create a really small sphere
